Bitcoin Static
=================

The goal of Bitcoin Static is to create sound money that is usable by everyone
in the world. We believe this is a civilization-changing technology which will
dramatically increase human flourishing, freedom, and prosperity. The project
aims to achieve this goal by implementing [proportional reward system](https://ergon.moe/prop_reward.pdf) to stabilize
the currency value over time.

What is Ergon?
---------------------

Ergon is a digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone,
anywhere in the world. It uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no
central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out
collectively by the network. Ergon is a descendant of Bitcoin Cash. It starts
from a new genesis block but shares most of the features, except the reward
structure and difficulty adjustment algorithm.

[Bitcoin Cash Node](https://bitcoincashnode.org), [Bitcoin ABC](https://www.bitcoinabc.org)
