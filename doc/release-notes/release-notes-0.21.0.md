Release Notes for Bitcoin Static version 0.21.0
==================================================

Bitcoin Static version 0.21.0 is now available from:

  <https://bitcoincashnode.org>

This is the first release of Bitcoin Static as a drop-in replacement for Bitcoin ABC 0.21.0. It is based on Bitcoin ABC 0.21.0, with minimal changes necessary to disable the Infrastructure Funding Proposal (IFP) soft forks. For exchanges and users, this client will follow the longest chain whether it includes IFP soft forks or not. For miners, running this client ensures the `getblocktemplate` RPC call will return a block with version bits that vote "NO" for the IFP soft forks. Additionally, unlike Bitcoin ABC, `getblocktemplate` will *not* automatically insert IFP white-list addresses into the coinbase transaction.

Minimal changes from Bitcoin ABC 0.21.0 to Bitcoin Static 0.21.0:
- All IFP soft fork logic, signaling logic and the hard-coded whitelist have been removed.
- Rebranding from Bitcoin ABC to Bitcoin Static.
- Qt GUI settings are automatically copied from Bitcoin ABC on first use of Bitcoin Static.

_Note regarding BIP9 and `getblockchaininfo` below: BIP9 is inactive due to no available proposals to vote on and it may be removed in a future release._

All other upgrade changes from ABC 0.21.0 are untouched and included below for reference.

----

This release includes the following features and fixes:

- The RPC `getrpcinfo` returns runtime details of the RPC server.
At the moment it returns the active commands and the corresponding execution time.

- Bump automatic replay protection to Nov 2020 upgrade.
