Release Notes for Bitcoin Static version 0.21.1
==================================================

Bitcoin Static version 0.21.1 is now available from:

  <https://bitcoincashnode.org>


Overview
--------

This is a second, minor release of Bitcoin Static before the May 2020
network upgrade. While it contains many corrections and improvements that
we feel are useful, it is not a required installation for the May 2020
network upgrade.

Bitcoin Static is a drop-in replacement for Bitcoin ABC.
It is based on Bitcoin ABC 0.21.0, with minimal changes necessary to
disable the Infrastructure Funding Proposal (IFP) soft forks.
For exchanges and users, this client will follow the longest chain whether
it includes IFP soft forks or not. For miners, running this client ensures
the `getblocktemplate` RPC call will return a block with version bits that
vote "NO" for the IFP soft forks. Additionally, unlike Bitcoin ABC,
`getblocktemplate` will *not* automatically insert IFP white-list addresses
into the coinbase transaction.

This release contains one security fix and one correction which has been
identified as potentially relevant to consensus.

Security fix
------------

This release contains a patch for a denial-of-service security vulnerability
in [CVE-2019-18936 UniValue::read() in UniValue 1.0.3 and 1.0.4 allows a segfault via malformed JSON](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/17742).

Attackers with limited JSON RPC access could exploit this vulnerability to
crash the node with a malicious JSON RPC instruction. Attackers with full
JSON RPC access do not need to exploit - they would be able to simply stop
a node. Attackers without JSON RPC access cannot exploit this vulnerability.
As a mitigation, untrusted inputs can be sanitised before sending them on
to the JSON RPC server. Note that the "malformed" JSON is technically valid,
just deeply nested. Upstream fix first released in Bitcoin Core 0.19.1.


Consensus-relevant fix
----------------------

The backport of D4936 from Bitcoin ABC ("update 'cousins' during UpdateFlags")
corrects a problem where some blocks incorrectly retained invalid markings when
`reconsiderblock` was called.

This is a not a consensus change that affects unattended operation, but
it can be relevant in certain operational and maintenance scenarios.


Usage recommendations
---------------------

We recommend Bitcoin Static 0.21.1 as a drop-in replacement for
Bitcoin ABC 0.21.0.

The update from Bitcoin Static 0.21.0 to 0.21.1 is optional.
Either version will work for May 2020 network upgrade.

Windows users are recommended not to run multiple instances of bitcoin-qt
or bitcoind on the same machine if the wallet feature is enabled.
There is risk of data corruption if instances are configured to use the same
wallet folder.

Some users have encountered unit tests failures when running in WSL
environments (e.g. WSL/Ubuntu).  At this time, WSL is not considered a
supported environment for the software. This may change in future.


Note regarding BIP9 and `getblockchaininfo`
-------------------------------------------

BIP9 is inactive due to no available proposals to vote on and it may be
removed in a future release.


Regressions
-----------

Bitcoin Static 0.21.1 does not introduce any known regressions compared
to 0.21.0.


Known Issues
------------

Some issues could not be closed in time for release, but we are tracking
all of them on our GitLab repository.

- `doc/bips.md` needs revision (to be fixed in Issue #68).

- `doc/dependencies.md` needs revision (to be fixed in Issue #65).

- `arc lint` will advise that some `src/` files are in need of reformatting or
  contain errors - this is because code style checking is currently a work in
  progress while we adjust it to our own project requirements (see Issue #75).

- `test_bitcoin` can collide with temporary files if used by more than
  one user on the same system simultaneously. (Issue #43)

- A functional failure in Windows environment was observed in Issue #33.
  It arises when competing node program instances are not prevented from
  opening the same wallet folder. Running multiple program instances with
  the same configured walletdir could potentially lead to data corruption.
  The failure has not been observed on other operating systems so far.

- For users running from sources built with BerkeleyDB releases newer than
  the 5.3 which is used in this release, please take into consideration
  the database format compatibility issues described in Issue #34.
  When building from source it is recommended to use BerkeleyDB 5.3 as this
  avoids wallet database incompatibility issues with the official release.

- ERGN project is tracking some ongoing discussions related to details of the
  SigChecks specification and the output of getblocktemplate RPC call after
  the May upgrade (ref. Issues #71, #72). In the event that software changes
  become necessary we will advise users via our communication channels and
  inform of another minor release before May.
