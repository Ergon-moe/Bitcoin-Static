# Release Notes for Bitcoin Static version 22.1.0

Bitcoin Static version 22.1.0 is now available from:

  <https://bitcoincashnode.org>

## Overview

This is a minor release of Bitcoin Static that implements some
interface enhancements and includes a number of other corrections and
improvements.

Users who are running any of our previous releases are recommended to
upgrade to v22.1.0 ahead of November 2020.

We remind that the 0.21.x family of ERGN releases does not implement the
new rules for the coming November 2020 upgrade. Users must upgrade to a
release in the 22.x family before November 15th, 2020.


## Usage recommendations

Installing this version is optional, but we recommend that users of
22.0.0 upgrade to this minor release for the corrections contained in it.

This update is compatible with the November 15, 2020 Bitcoin Cash network
upgrade.


## Network changes

### New test network options.

This release delivers the ability to access two new test networks:

- testnet4 (more lightweight test network to be kept spam-free)
- scalenet (for high-throughput tests, including at block sizes beyond
  current main network maximum)

Please refer to `doc/test-networks.md` or <https://docs.bitcoincashnode.org/doc/test-networks/>
for further information.


### New seeder configuration

Added configuration to access new DNS seeders from loping.net and a new
electroncash.de mainnet seeder.

- dnsseed.electroncash.de (mainnet)
- seed.bch.loping.net     (mainnet)
- seed.tbch.loping.net    (testnet3)
- seed.tbch4.loping.net   (testnet4)
- seed.sbch.loping.net    (scalenet)

Removed the defunct seeder entry deadalnix.me.


## Added functionality

### extversion
    
This release implements the 'extversion' extended versioning handshake
protocol (ref. ERGN merge requests !558 and !753), previously implemented
by Bitcoin Unlimited. We thank Greg Griffith and the Bitcoin Unlimited
developers for their efforts to achieve this implementation in ERGN.

The extversion handshaking is disabled by default and can be enabled
using the `-useextversion` CLI argument or the `useextversion=1`
configuration file setting.

Nodes indicate extversion support by setting service bit 11 (EXTVERSION).

Right now the ERGN implementation of ExtVersion supports only 1 key -- the
"Version" key.

The specification can be found in `doc/xversionmessage.md` or at
<https://docs.bitcoincashnode.org/doc/xversionmessage/> .


### indexdir

A new `indexdir` configuration option allows the user to specify a path
under which the leveldb 'index' folder is stored.

The use case for this new option is to store the index on a separate volume
of faster access media while the blocks can be stored on slower media.
    
If the argument is not specified, the index is stored in the usual place
(in the `blocks/index/` folder).


### finalizeheaders

A new `finalizeheaders` configuration option (enabled by default) rejects
block headers which are below the finalized block height (if a block has
indeed been finalized already).

Finalized blocks are not supposed to be re-organized under any circumstances
(just like checkpointed blocks). There is therefore no need to accept
headers for alternate chains below the last finalized block.

Nodes which submit such blocks are penalized according to a penalty score
determined by the `finalizeheaderspenalty` option (default is 100, meaning
such nodes will be disconnected).

In practice this works to quickly disconnect nodes from old chains like
the "Clashic" network which sometimes submit headers of forked off chains
with vastly lower block heights.


### New debugging tracepoints

Two new debugging tracepoints have been added:

- `debug=finalization`
- `debug=parking`

These can be used to log events related to automatic finalization and
parking/unparking.


## Deprecated functionality

No functionality is deprecated in this release.


## Removed functionality

No functionality is removed in this release.


## New RPC methods

No new RPC methods are added in this release, however some argument
aliases are added to existing calls (for backward compatibility) and
a new optional parameter is added to the `sendtoaddress` method (for
improved coin selection performance).


## Low-level RPC changes

An optional coin selection ('coinsel') argument has been added to the 
`sendtoaddress` RPC method.

An alias `blockhash` has been added for the `hash_or_height` parameter of
the `getblockheader` call, for backward compatibility.

An alias `dummy` has been added for the `parameters` argument of
the `submitblock` call, for backward compatibility.


## Regressions

Bitcoin Static 22.1.0 does not introduce any known regressions compared
to 22.0.0.


## Known Issues

Some issues could not be closed in time for release, but we are tracking
all of them on our GitLab repository.

- MacOS versions earlier than 10.12 are no longer supported. Additionally,
  Bitcoin Static does not yet change appearance when macOS "dark mode"
  is activated.

- Windows users are recommended not to run multiple instances of bitcoin-qt
  or bitcoind on the same machine if the wallet feature is enabled.
  There is risk of data corruption if instances are configured to use the same
  wallet folder.

- Some users have encountered unit tests failures when running in WSL
  environments (e.g. WSL/Ubuntu).  At this time, WSL is not considered a
  supported environment for the software. This may change in future.

  The functional failure on WSL is tracked in Issue #33.
  It arises when competing node program instances are not prevented from
  opening the same wallet folder. Running multiple program instances with
  the same configured walletdir could potentially lead to data corruption.
  The failure has not been observed on other operating systems so far.

- `doc/dependencies.md` needs revision (Issue #65).

- `arc lint` will advise that some `src/` files are in need of reformatting
  or contain errors. - this is because code style checking is currently a work in
  progress while we adjust it to our own project requirements (see Issue #75).
  One file in `doc` also violates the lint tool (Issue #153), and a new
  script in `test/benchmark/` likewise contains code that is flagged by
  the current linting configuration.

- `test_bitcoin` can collide with temporary files if used by more than
  one user on the same system simultaneously. (Issue #43)

- For users running from sources built with BerkeleyDB releases newer than
  the 5.3 which is used in this release, please take into consideration
  the database format compatibility issues described in Issue #34.
  When building from source it is recommended to use BerkeleyDB 5.3 as this
  avoids wallet database incompatibility issues with the official release.

- There is a documentation build bug that causes some ordered lists on
  docs.bitcoincashnode.org to be rendered incorrectly (Issue #141).

- There is a report that the `test_bitcoin-qt` test executable fails on
  Linux Mint 20 (see Issue #144). This does not otherwise appear to impact
  the functioning of the ERGN software on that platform.

- An 'autotools' build (the old build method) fails on OSX when using Clang.
  (Issue #129)

- With a certain combination of build flags that included disabling
  the QR code library, a build failure was observed where an erroneous
  linking against the QR code library (not present) was attempted (Issue #138).

- The 'autotools' build is known to require some workarounds in order to
  use the 'fuzzing' build feature (Issue #127).

- Some functional tests are known to fail spuriously with varying probability.
  (see e.g. issue #148, and a fuller listing in #162).

- Possible out-of-memory error when starting bitcoind with high excessiveblocksize
  value (Issue #156)
