# Release Notes for Bitcoin Static version 22.2.0

Bitcoin Static version 22.2.0 is now available from:

  <https://bitcoincashnode.org>

## Overview

This is a minor release of Bitcoin Static that implements some
interface enhancements and includes a number of other corrections and
improvements.

Users who are running any of our previous releases are recommended to
upgrade to v22.2.0 as part of regular maintenance.


## Usage recommendations

Installing this version is optional, but we strongly recommend that users of
22.1.0 upgrade to this release for the corrections, performance improvements
and post-upgrade checkpoints contained in it.


## Network changes

Policy has been changed to enforce standard transactions on testnet4.
This is to have a test network that is close to mainnet.
If you wish to experiment with non-standard transactions, please use
testnet3 or scalenet.


## Change of `-maxmempool` default value

The default value for `-maxmempool` has been changed to 10 times the
`excessiveblocksize`, i.e. 320 MB on mainet and 2560 MB on scalenet.
If your node does not have sufficient free memory to accomodate such a
maxmempool setting when running on `scalenet`, we recommend to upgrade your
memory capacity or override this default.


## Added functionality

### Thread names in logs

Log lines can be prefixed with the name of the thread that caused the log. To
enable this behavior, use`-logthreadnames=1`.


## Deprecated functionality

The `getnetworkhashps` RPC has an option to calculate average hashrate
"since last difficulty change". This option works incorrectly, assuming
that difficulty changes every 2016 blocks. The option is considered
irrelevant with the per-block DAA adjustments introduced in 2017,
and is scheduled for removal in a future release.


## Removed functionality

No functionality is removed in this release.


## New RPC methods

No new RPC methods are added in this release,


## Low-level RPC changes

The `getblockstats` RPC is faster for fee calculation by using BlockUndo
data. Also, `-txindex` is no longer required and `getblockstats` works for
all non-pruned blocks.

A discrepancy was noticed in the argument and result value names of
`getexcessiveblock` and `setexcessiveblock` RPC calls between the interface
documentation, actual required argument names, error message and name of
returned result. A two-step procedure will be followed to correct this.

1. In this release, the RPC help and error messages for the `setexcessiveblock`
   command have been corrected to `maxBlockSize` to align the name of the
   argument, previously `blockSize`, with the name required when the
   "named argument" form of the call is used.

2. In a future release, the parameter name `maxBlockSize` introduced by
   this version will be renamed to 'excessiveBlockSize' in order to make it
   the same as the result value of the `getexcessiveblock` RPC call.


## Regressions

Bitcoin Static 22.2.0 does not introduce any known regressions compared
to 22.1.0.


## Known Issues

Some issues could not be closed in time for release, but we are tracking
all of them on our GitLab repository.

- MacOS versions earlier than 10.12 are no longer supported. Additionally,
  Bitcoin Static does not yet change appearance when macOS "dark mode"
  is activated.

- Windows users are recommended not to run multiple instances of bitcoin-qt
  or bitcoind on the same machine if the wallet feature is enabled.
  There is risk of data corruption if instances are configured to use the same
  wallet folder.

- Some users have encountered unit tests failures when running in WSL
  environments (e.g. WSL/Ubuntu).  At this time, WSL is not considered a
  supported environment for the software. This may change in future.

  The functional failure on WSL is tracked in Issue #33.
  It arises when competing node program instances are not prevented from
  opening the same wallet folder. Running multiple program instances with
  the same configured walletdir could potentially lead to data corruption.
  The failure has not been observed on other operating systems so far.

- `doc/dependencies.md` needs revision (Issue #65).

- `test_bitcoin` can collide with temporary files if used by more than
  one user on the same system simultaneously. (Issue #43)

- For users running from sources built with BerkeleyDB releases newer than
  the 5.3 which is used in this release, please take into consideration
  the database format compatibility issues described in Issue #34.
  When building from source it is recommended to use BerkeleyDB 5.3 as this
  avoids wallet database incompatibility issues with the official release.

- There is a documentation build bug that causes some ordered lists on
  docs.bitcoincashnode.org to be rendered incorrectly (Issue #141).

- The `test_bitcoin-qt` test executable fails on Linux Mint 20
  (see Issue #144). This does not otherwise appear to impact the functioning
  of the ERGN software on that platform.

- An 'autotools' build (the old build method) fails on OSX when using Clang.
  (Issue #129)

- With a certain combination of build flags that included disabling
  the QR code library, a build failure was observed where an erroneous
  linking against the QR code library (not present) was attempted (Issue #138).

- The 'autotools' build is known to require some workarounds in order to
  use the 'fuzzing' build feature (Issue #127).

- Some functional tests are known to fail spuriously with varying probability.
  (see e.g. issue #148, and a fuller listing in #162).

- Possible out-of-memory error when starting bitcoind with high excessiveblocksize
  value (Issue #156)

- There are obstacles building the current version on Ubuntu 16.04 (see #187).
  These are worked around by our packaging system, but users trying to build
  the software from scratch are advised to either upgrade to more recent Ubuntu,
  or retrofit the necessary toolchains and perform the same build steps for
  Xenial as registered in our packaging repository, or build in a VM using
  the gitian build instructions, or run our reproducible binary release builds.

- The `getnetworkhashps` RPC call is not adapted to per-block DAA (see #193).
  It has an option to calculate average hashrate "since last difficulty change"
  and wrongly assumes difficulty changes every 2016 blocks. This irrelevant
  option will likely be removed in the next release.

- A problem was observed on scalenet where nodes would sometimes hang for
  around 10 minutes, accepting RPC connections but not responding to them
  (see #210).

- `arc lint` will advise that some `src/` files are in need of reformatting
  or contain errors. - this is because code style checking is currently a work in
  progress while we adjust it to our own project requirements (see Issue #75).
  One file in `doc` also violates the lint tool (Issue #153), and a new
  script in `test/benchmark/` likewise contains code that is flagged by
  the current linting configuration. There are also RPC parameter type
  inconsistencies that flag linting checks (see #182).
