Bitcoin Static Setup
=======================

Bitcoin Static is a fork of Bitcoin ABC, which is an original Bitcoin Cash client and builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of Bitcoin Cash transactions, which requires a few hundred gigabytes of disk space. Depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

To download Bitcoin Static, visit [bitcoincashnode.org](https://bitcoincashnode.org/).

Verify
---------------------

If you download the associated signature files with the binaries from the above link,
you can verify the integrity of the binaries by following these instructions, replacing
VERSION with the value relevant to you:

Get the keys for versions 0.21.1 or later:

```
VERSION="0.21.1"
URL="https://download.bitcoincashnode.org/releases/${VERSION}/src/bitcoin-cash-node-${VERSION}.tar.gz"
KEYS_FILE="bitcoin-cash-node-${VERSION}/contrib/gitian-signing/keys.txt"
wget -q -O - "${URL}" | tar -zxOf - "${KEYS_FILE}" | while read FINGERPRINT _; do gpg --recv-keys "${FINGERPRINT}"; done
```

Get the keys for version 0.21.0:
```
URL="https://download.bitcoincashnode.org/keys/keys.txt"
wget -q -O - "${URL}" | while read FINGERPRINT _; do gpg --recv-keys "${FINGERPRINT}"; done
```

Check the binaries (all versions):
```
FILE_PATTERN="./*-sha256sums.${VERSION}.asc"
gpg --verify-files ${FILE_PATTERN}
grep "bitcoin-cash-node-${VERSION}" ${FILE_PATTERN} | cut -d " " -f 2- | xargs ls 2> /dev/null |\
  xargs -i grep -h "{}" ${FILE_PATTERN} | uniq | sha256sum -c
```

*IMPORTANT NOTE:* The first time you run this, all of the signing keys will be UNTRUSTED and you will see warnings
indicating this.  For best security practices, you should `gpg --sign-key <signer key>` for each release signer key
and rerun the above script (there should be no warnings the second time). If the keys change unexpectedly,
the presence of those warnings should be heeded with extreme caution.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Bitcoin Static on your native platform.
