`walletcreatefundedpsbt` JSON-RPC command
=========================================

**`walletcreatefundedpsbt [{"txid":"hex","vout":n,"sequence":n},...] [{"address":amount},{"data":"hex"},...] ( locktime options bip32derivs )`**

```
Creates and funds a transaction in the Partially Signed Transaction format. Inputs will be added if supplied inputs are not enough
Implements the Creator and Updater roles.
```

Arguments
---------

```
1. "inputs"                (array, required) A json array of json objects
     [
       {
         "txid":"id",      (string, required) The transaction id
         "vout":n,         (numeric, required) The output number
         "sequence":n      (numeric, optional) The sequence number
       }
       ,...
     ]
2. "outputs"               (array, required) a json array with outputs (key-value pairs)
   [
    {
      "address": x.xxx,    (obj, optional) A key-value pair. The key (string) is the bitcoin address, the value (float or string) is the amount in ERG
    },
    {
      "data": "hex"        (obj, optional) A key-value pair. The key must be "data", the value is hex-encoded data
    }
    ,...                     More key-value pairs of the above form. For compatibility reasons, a dictionary, which holds the key-value pairs directly, is also
                             accepted as second parameter.
   ]
3. locktime                  (numeric, optional, default=0) Raw locktime. Non-0 value also locktime-activates inputs
4. options                 (object, optional)
   {
     "changeAddress"          (string, optional, default pool address) The bitcoin address to receive the change
     "changePosition"         (numeric, optional, default random) The index of the change output
     "includeWatching"        (boolean, optional, default false) Also select inputs which are watch only
     "lockUnspents"           (boolean, optional, default false) Lock selected unspent outputs
     "feeRate"                (numeric, optional, default not set: makes wallet determine the fee) Set a specific fee rate in ERG/kB
     "subtractFeeFromOutputs" (array, optional) A json array of integers.
                              The fee will be equally deducted from the amount of each specified output.
                              The outputs are specified by their zero-based index, before any change output is added.
                              Those recipients will receive less bitcoins than you enter in their corresponding amount field.
                              If no outputs are specified here, the sender pays the fee.
                                  [vout_index,...]
   }
5. bip32derivs                    (boolean, optional, default=false) If true, includes the BIP 32 derivation paths for public keys if we know them
```

Result
------

```
{
  "psbt": "value",        (string)  The resulting raw transaction (base64-encoded string)
  "fee":       n,         (numeric) Fee in ERG the resulting transaction pays
  "changepos": n          (numeric) The position of the added change output, or -1
}
```

Examples
--------

```
Create a transaction with no inputs
> bitcoin-cli walletcreatefundedpsbt "[{\"txid\":\"myid\",\"vout\":0}]" "[{\"data\":\"00010203\"}]"
```
