# Fedora / CentOS build guide

(updated for Fedora 31)

## Preparation

Minimal build requirements:

```bash
sudo dnf install boost-devel cmake gcc-c++ git git-lfs libevent-devel miniupnpc-devel ninja-build openssl-devel python3 zeromq-devel
```

You can do without either of the `miniupnpc-devel` and `zeromq-devel` package,
then you just need to pass `-DENABLE_UPNP=OFF` or `-DBUILD_BITCOIN_ZMQ=OFF` on
the `cmake` command line. You can also do without the `git-lfs` package, if you
don't intend to run the benchmark tool.

BerkeleyDB 5.3 or later is required for the wallet. This can be installed with:

```bash
    sudo dnf install libdb-cxx-devel libdb-devel
```

If you also want to build the GUI client `bitcoin-qt` Qt 5 is necessary.
To build with Qt 5 you need the following packages installed:

```bash
    sudo dnf install qt5-qttools-devel qt5-qtbase-devel protobuf-devel qrencode-devel
```

You can do without the `qrencode-devel` package, just pass `-DENABLE_QRCODE=OFF`
on the cmake command line.

## Building Bitcoin Static

Once you have installed the required dependencies (see sections above), you can
build Bitcoin Static as such:

First fetch the code (if you haven't done so already).

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node.git
```

Change to the BCN directory, make `build` dir, and change to that directory

```bash
cd bitcoin-cash-node/
mkdir build
cd build
```

Next you need to choose between building just the node, the node with wallet
support, or the node and the QT client.

**Choose one:**

```bash
# to build just the node, no wallet functionality, choose this:
cmake -GNinja .. -DBUILD_BITCOIN_WALLET=OFF -DBUILD_BITCOIN_QT=OFF
```

```bash
# to build the node, with wallet functionality, but without GUI, choose this:
cmake -GNinja .. -DBUILD_BITCOIN_QT=OFF
```

```bash
# to build node and QT GUI client, choose this:
cmake -GNinja ..
```

Next, finish the build

```bash
ninja
```

You will find the `bitcoind`, `bitcoin-cli`, `bitcoin-tx` (and optionally `bitcoin-qt`)
binaries in `/build/src/(qt)`.

Optionally, run the tests

```bash
ninja check # recommended
```

After a successful test you can install the newly built binaries to your `bin` directory.
Note that this will probably overwrite any previous version installed, including
binaries from different sources.

```bash
sudo ninja install #optional
```
