# Release Notes for Bitcoin Cash Node version 24.1.0

Bitcoin Cash Node version 24.1.0 is now available from:

  <https://bitcoincashnode.org>

## Overview

This is a minor release of Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN), containing:

- Upgrade of TOR network support from v2 to v3
- Upgrade checkpoints for May 15, 2022 upgrade

This version contains many further corrections and improvements
and modifies the storage format of the internal peer database to accommodate
new network address formats.


## Usage recommendations

Users who are running v24.0.0 are encouraged to upgrade to v24.1.0.
It offers up to date TOR network support, improves synching performance and
fixes minor bugs.

MacOSX users who are running on OS versions prior Mojave (10.14), such
as 10.12 or 10.13, and who are running 24.0.0 release binaries, are
advised to keep running 24.0.0 until they can upgrade to Mojave.


## Network changes

- The Tor onion service that is automatically created by setting the
  `-listenonion` configuration parameter will now be created as a Tor v3 service
  instead of Tor v2. The private key that was used for Tor v2 (if any) will be
  left untouched in the `onion_private_key` file in the data directory (see
  `-datadir`) and can be removed if not needed. Bitcoin Cash Node will no longer
  attempt to read it. The private key for the Tor v3 service will be saved in a
  file named `onion_v3_private_key`. To use the deprecated Tor v2 service (not
  recommended), then `onion_private_key` can be copied over
  `onion_v3_private_key`, e.g.
  `cp -f onion_private_key onion_v3_private_key`.

- If using the `-listenonion=1` option (default: 1 if unspecified), then an
  additional new bind `address:port` will be used for hidden-service-only incoming
  .onion connections. On mainnet, this will be 127.0.0.1:8334. This bind address
  is in **addition** to any `-bind=` options specified on the CLI and/or in the
  config file.
    - To specify the local onion port to bind to explicitly, use the new syntax,
      `-bind=<HOST>:<PORT>=onion`. See `bitcoind -help` for more information on
      the new `=onion` syntax which is used to specify local tor listening ports.
    - To not create an additional bind endpoint for tor, and/or to disable tor
      hidden service support, use `-listenonion=0`.

  Note: As before, tor hidden services are always advertised publicly using a
  "generic" port for maximal anonymity (such as 8333 on mainnet, 18333 on
  testnet3, and so on). The `-bind=<HOST>:<PORT>=onion` syntax is to simply
  specify the local bind address which is connected-to privately by the
  local `tor` process when a remote node connects to your .onion hidden
  service.

## Added functionality

- Added wallet-tool

- Added a new logging option, `-debug=httptrace` which logs all HTTP data
  to/from the internal JSON-RPC and REST server, including HTTP content.
    - This is an advanced debugging option intended for troubleshooting the
      low-level JSON-RPC and/or REST protocol, primarily aimed at developers.
    - This option is not enabled by default, even if using `-debug=all`, and
      must be explicitly enabled using `-debug=httptrace`.
    - Unlike the regular `-debug=http` debug option, incoming strings and data
      are *not* sanitized in any way in the log file, and are simply logged
      verbatim as they come in off the network.

## Deprecated functionality

The `setexcessiveblock` RPC method has been deprecated.
Please use the `excessiveblocksize` configuration option together with a
restart of the node if you want to adapt this parameter.

An upgrade to Qt version 5.15.3 is planned for our next release.  As a result,
compatibility of the release binary with some older Linux platforms will be 
affected:

- Support for glibc versions older than 2.27 is now deprecated
  and may no longer be supported in a future release. This will impact older 
  platforms like CentOS 7, Debian 9, Mint 19, and Ubuntu 14 & 16.
- Support for platforms that lack the X protocol C-language Binding library
  (libxcb) is deprecated, and future releases may require this library.
    - This library seems available on most major Linux distributions but we urge you 
      to check your node platform and notify us via a GitLab issue or via a comment on [MR 1524](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/merge_requests/1523)
      if you do not have this library.

If you are presently running on such older platforms, please upgrade to a newer OS
version ahead of our next release.

## Modified functionality

- Netmasks that contain 1-bits after 0-bits (the 1-bits are not contiguous
  on the left side, e.g. 255.0.255.255) are no longer accepted.
  They are invalid according to RFC 4632.

- The `-whitelistrelay` default has been restored to enabled. The help text
  indicated the default being enabled, despite the default actually being
  disabled. This has been broken since v22.0.0.

### peers.dat file format

The node's known peers are persisted to disk in a file called `peers.dat`.
The format of this file has been changed in a backwards-incompatible way in
order to accommodate the storage of Tor v3 and other BIP155 addresses. This
means that if the file is modified by this version or newer then older
versions will not be able to read it. Those old versions, in the event of a
downgrade, will log an error message that deserialization has failed and will
continue normal operation as if the file was missing, creating a new empty
one.


## Removed functionality

TORv2 support is replaced by TORv3.

## New RPC methods

None.

## User interface changes

- `peers.dat` file has changed format due to BIP155 / TORv3 support
- `-blocksonly` option has been unhidden on bitcoind / bitcoin-qt command line help
- `walletlock`, `walletpassphrase` and `walletpassphrasechange` RPC methods
   were lacking documentation, which has been added.

## Regressions

Bitcoin Cash Node 24.1.0 does not introduce any known regressions as compared to 24.0.0.

## Known Issues

Some issues could not be closed in time for release, but we are tracking all of them on our GitLab repository.

- MacOS versions earlier than 10.14 are no longer supported. Additionally,
  Bitcoin Cash Node does not yet change appearance when macOS "dark mode"
  is activated.

- Windows users are recommended not to run multiple instances of bitcoin-qt
  or bitcoind on the same machine if the wallet feature is enabled.
  There is risk of data corruption if instances are configured to use the same
  wallet folder.

- Some users have encountered unit tests failures when running in WSL
  environments (e.g. WSL/Ubuntu).  At this time, WSL is not considered a
  supported environment for the software. This may change in future.

  The functional failure on WSL is tracked in Issue #33.
  It arises when competing node program instances are not prevented from
  opening the same wallet folder. Running multiple program instances with
  the same configured walletdir could potentially lead to data corruption.
  The failure has not been observed on other operating systems so far.

- `doc/dependencies.md` needs revision (Issue #65).

- For users running from sources built with BerkeleyDB releases newer than
  the 5.3 which is used in this release, please take into consideration
  the database format compatibility issues described in Issue #34.
  When building from source it is recommended to use BerkeleyDB 5.3 as this
  avoids wallet database incompatibility issues with the official release.

- The `test_bitcoin-qt` test executable fails on Linux Mint 20
  (see Issue #144). This does not otherwise appear to impact the functioning
  of the BCHN software on that platform.

- With a certain combination of build flags that included disabling
  the QR code library, a build failure was observed where an erroneous
  linking against the QR code library (not present) was attempted (Issue #138).

- Possible out-of-memory error when starting bitcoind with high excessiveblocksize
  value (Issue #156)

- A problem was observed on scalenet where nodes would sometimes hang for
  around 10 minutes, accepting RPC connections but not responding to them
  (see #210).

- Startup and shutdown time of nodes on scalenet can be long (see Issue #313).

- On Mac platforms with current Qt, the splash screen can be maximized,
  but it cannot be unmaximized again (see #255). This issue will be resolved
  by a Qt library upgrade in a future release.

- Race condition in one of the `p2p_invalid_messages.py` tests (see Issue #409).

- Occasional failure in bchn-txbroadcastinterval.py (see Issue #403).

- wallet_keypool.py test failure when run as part of suite on certain many-core
  platforms (see Issue #380).

- Spurious 'insufficient funds' failure during p2p_stresstest.py benchmark
  (see Issue #377).

- `bitcoin-tx` tool does not have BIP69 support (optional or enforced) yet.
  (see Issue #383).

- secp256k1 now no longer works with latest openssl3.x series. There are
  workarounds (see Issue #364).

- Spurious `AssertionError: Mempool sync timed out` in several tests
  (see Issue #357).
